## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(UsingR); 
#data(father.son);
x <- father.son$sheight
n <- length(x)



print(var(x))
print(sd(x))

hist(x)
```
these are the population standard deviation and variance

```{r}
var(x)/n
sd(x)/sqrt(n)
```
these are however variance of the mean of the samples

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
